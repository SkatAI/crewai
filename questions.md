## Global

- it's difficult to know how to create tasks. What granularity is optimal.
- some tasks could be easily one with regular code no LLMs. what's more efficient: LLM agent or direct code (can be generated with LLM). for instance, extract names from a highly structured document. Regex are 100% accurate. can also help to evaluate the accuracy of LLM agent.

## Agents

- when creating agents what are the required arguments, optional arguments
  - https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/agents
  - why `max_iter` ? what does the agent do at each iteration ?
    - on the evaluation happening in `max_iter` https://claude.ai/chat/fd81e7a7-2d3a-4cbb-b6ca-2ce8ee7f837f
  - what's the diff and impact of role, goal and backstory
    - On the impact of backstory on teaching style https://claude.ai/chat/c271860e-4dcb-4223-a18e-989154c92ed0

## Role definitions

- NER vs arguments: The tasks for the information extraction agent are : NER and extracting key arguments. arguments are more complex to extract than NER. should we have 2 agents? one for NER and one for arguments ?
  - see Political Analyst Agent
  - how do you measure NER accuracy (should be doable)
  - how do you measure arguments extraction accuracy ?

- in the 1st example given by Claude, the roles overlap

## tasks

https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/tasks

- exemple of task and task output : https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/tasks#example
- how to use tools such as SerperDevTool : see https://chatgpt.com/c/6724924a-f234-800e-85d6-7cb2bfeaccc1
- `context` attribute to chain tasks


## Gathering data - Serper API

- Serper can I restrict to a domain or type of pages ?
- should I create a scraper bot with code LLM generated
- ScrapegraphAI ? https://github.com/ScrapeGraphAI/Scrapegraph-ai

## Prompt length

- Passing the entire transcript won't work. too long.
- Instead of passing the text if we pass the URL, does that make a difference.

## Issues

The lib version are updated all the time,m frequently,

- code becomes obsolete very quickly
- code generated by an LLM does not work. needs to be updated
